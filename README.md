###  

I'm Aron, a software engineer and a computer science graduate from Charlotte, North Carolina.

I'm primarily interested in full-stack development and currently work as a software engineer intern at Vertaeon, a data science startup.

Outside of work, I'm interested in following the developments of AI, robotics and science in general. I also have a love for extreme sports.
