### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gazi, a software engineer from Toronto, Canada.

I'm primarily interested in full-stack development and currently work as a software engineer at @Amazon.

I'm fascinated by large-scale, high-impact products and have worked on industry-leading services as well as apps that have 100M+ installs. I have contributed to major feature launches and automating systems in customer-facing consoles with high traffic.

Outside of work, I'm interested in following the developments of science. I also play a lot of video games and make tech-related TikToks (470,000 followers and counting).
