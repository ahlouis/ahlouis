I'm Aron, a software engineer from Charlotte, North Carolina.

I'm primarily interested in full-stack development and currently work as a software engineer at Vertaeon.

I'm fascinated by large-scale, high-impact products.

Outside of work, I'm interested in following the developments of science. I also am passionate about fitness.
